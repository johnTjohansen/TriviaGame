HW - week 5 homework - Timed Trivia Game

American Horror Story - Coven trivia quiz
- 9 questions with 15 seconds to guess each (from 3 choices)
- gives you the correct answer if you guess wrong
- at end, show how many correct, incorrect, and timeout guesses
- uses some Bootstrap; game written in Javascript and uses Jquery and a Google font

Had some problems getting this one to work.  It identifies correct answers as wrong because I was not getting the right identifying value from the chosen answer.  My timer counts down at varying speeds.  Also had issues with referencing specific properties within my question objects.  I suspect I used reserved words as names but ran out of time to pursue that theory.
